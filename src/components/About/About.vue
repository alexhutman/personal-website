        I graduated from Quinnipiac University in 2019 with a B.S. in computer science and a B.A.
        in mathematics and am currently a software engineer at Cigna in the Data and Analytics
        group.

        In my spare time, I enjoy learning about topics in math and computer science, working out,
        using the Oxford comma, and playing video games.
